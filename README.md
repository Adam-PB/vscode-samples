# vscode-samples

This repository contains sample applications customized for Visual Studio Code. Each sample is a self contained workspace with configuration files specific to that folder. 

These examples require [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to be installed on your path.  If you don't already have this installed then you can install like so: (you may need administrator rights to do this)

```
npm install -g gulp
```

To get started, cd into the sample directory, run `npm install` to install any necessary dependencies, and then start code:

To run the JavaScript sample:
``` bash
cd node-express-javascript
npm install
code .
```

To run the TypeScript sample:
``` bash
cd node-express-typescript
npm install
code .
```
